# OPC Server - Alias CSV File
# Format as follows:
# GroupName,AliasName,"Item Path",DataType,ReadOnly,PollAlways,UpdateRate
# e.g.: [MyGroup1,MyAlias,"Plc1.4:1001",3,1,1,500
# 
# Tips: - do not leave spaces between commas and values
#       - consult user's manual for valid data type enumerations
#       - always provide an update rate if poll always is true
#       - aliases are case sensitive - ensure you use appropriate case
# DataType: 8 = string, 7 = date, 5 = real8 (double)
